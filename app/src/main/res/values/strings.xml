    <string name="gta_des">The game is played from a third-person perspective and its world is
        navigated on foot or by vehicle. The open world design lets the player freely roam San
        Andreas, consisting of three metropolitan cities: Los Santos, San Fierro, and Las Venturas,
        based on Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Las Vegas, respectively. The narrative is based on
        multiple real-life events in Los Angeles, including the Bloods and Crips street gang rivalry,
        1990s crack epidemic, 1992 Los Angeles riots, and the Rampart scandal. The game was released
        in October 2004 for the PlayStation 2, and in 2005 for Windows and the Xbox. Enhanced versions
        were released in the 2010s, followed by a remastered version in 2021.
